# Masternode
Automation Scripts for XSN Masternodes


## Update Masternode

To run you just need to execute:

```bash masternode.sh update```

The script assumes your xsncore directory is at `~/.xsncore/` however
you can set where is your xsncore directory with `XSNCORE_PATH`:

```
XSNCORE_PATH=your_xsncore_dir_path bash masternode.sh update
```
